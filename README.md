# LoxBerry-Plugin-Lox2MQTT

LoxBerry plugin to enable communication between the Loxone Miniserver and MQTT. This plugin connects to the Loxone Miniserver websocket and the [LoxBerry MQTT Gategay](https://wiki.loxberry.de/plugins/mqtt_gateway/start)) and publishes Miniserver state changes over MQTT. Furthermore, specific commands can be send over MQTT to control the Miniserver directly.
